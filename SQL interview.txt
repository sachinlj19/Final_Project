SQL Interview Questions
1.What is difference between primary key,Unique key,Foreign Key and composite key
->Primary key: The primary key in SQL is a single, or a group of fields or columns that can uniquely identify a row in a table. Putting it simply, it is a column that accepts unique values for each row.
  Unique key:UNIQUE key constraint (or condition) does not allow duplicate values in a column of a table, i.e. it is used to uniquely identify a record in a table.
  Foreign Key :A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table. The table with the foreign key is called the child table, and the table with the primary key is called the referenced or parent table.
  composite key: 


2.What are the set operators present in SQL
->Set operators are used to join the results of two (or more) SELECT statements. The SET operators available in Oracle 11g are UNION,UNION ALL,INTERSECT,and MINUS.

3.Why we create view in SQL
->Views are generally used to focus, simplify, and customize the perception each user has of the database. Views can be used as security mechanisms by letting users access data through the view, without granting the users permissions to directly access the underlying base tables of the view.

4.What is stored Procedure
-> A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again. So if you have an SQL query that you write over and over again, save it as a stored procedure, and then just call it to execute it.

5.Explain the joins in SQL
->the SQL JOIN is a command clause that combines records from two or more tables in a database. It is a means of combining data in fields from two tables by using values common to each table.Four types of joins: left, right, inner, and outer. In general, you'll only really need to use inner joins and left outer joins. 

6.What is difference between Union and union All
->UNION only returns unique. UNION ALL returns all records, including duplicates.

7.What is difference between minus and intersect
->INTERSECT compares the data between tables and returns only the rows of data that exist in both tables. MINUS compares the data between tables and returns the rows of data that exist only in the first table you specify

8.Can you write minus query result using join
->NO


9.When you use group by and havin
->GROUP BY: This clause is used to group the data based on one or more columns. - HAVING: This clause is used to filter the grouped data based on certain conditions.

10.What is difference between row_number, rank and dense_rank
->The row_number gives continuous numbers, while rank and dense_rank give the same rank for duplicates, but the next number in rank is as per continuous order so you will see a jump but in dense_rank doesn't have any gap in rankings.

11. Explain Lag and lead Function
->The LEAD function is used to access data from SUBSEQUENT rows along with data from the current row. The LAG function is used to access data from PREVIOUS rows along with data from the current row. An ORDER BY clause is required when working with LEAD and LAG functions, but a PARTITION BY clause is optional.

12.Explain Windowing functions
->A window function is an SQL function where the input values are taken from a "window" of one or more rows in the results set of a SELECT statement. Window functions are distinguished from other SQL functions by the presence of an OVER clause. If a function has an OVER clause, then it is a window function.

13.Explain Analytical Functions
->Analytic functions calculate an aggregate value based on a group of rows. 

14.diffrent types of operators in SQL (Arithmetic, Logical, Relational, Etc)
->There are three types of operators in SQL: Arithmetic Operators, String Operators and Logical Operators. Operators are used in SQL to perform specific mathematical, logical or comparison operations on the records in a database.

15.Explain Split and trim function in sql
->The split() function can be used to split a given string or a line by specifying one of the substrings of the given string as the delimiter
  The TRIM() function removes the space character OR other specified characters from the start or end of a string.

24.diffrence between drop, truncate and delet
->The DELETE command deletes one or more existing records from the table in the database. The DROP Command drops the complete table from the database. The TRUNCATE Command deletes all the rows from the existing table, leaving the row with the column names.

25.ACID Property?
->ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability: 
Atomicity: All operations in a transaction succeed or every operation is rolled back. Consistency: On the completion of a transaction, the database is structurally sound. Isolation: Transactions do not contend with one another.

26.Explain Normalization and denormalization
->Normalizing a database involves removing redundancy which means there will be no duplicate entries of the same data. Denormalization is a process that adds some redundant data into a normalized database to enhance its functionality and minimize the running time of specific database queries.

27.what is clustered and non-clustered index?
->A clustered index is used to define the order or to sort the table or arrange the data by alphabetical order just like a dictionary. A non-clustered index collects the data at one place and records at another place. It is faster than a non-clustered index.
